				When incorporating the Galil Rule, we can use logic similar to that of KMP to
				optimize our shifts. After finding a full match, instead of shifting by 1 we shift
				by the period <i>k</i>. After that shift, we don't need to compare the first{' '}
				<i>k</i> characters in the pattern because we've already compared them and know that
				they match!
